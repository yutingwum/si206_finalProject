Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?   # 2

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?
Movie



* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
- imdb id 
- title
- director
- released year
- imdb rating
- list of actors
- genre
- num of language
- Revenue



* What will 1 instance of this class represent?
a Movie object with imdb id, title, director, released year, imdb rating, list of actors, genre, num of languages, revenue



* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?
- imdb_id (imdb id) 
- title (title)
- director (director)
- release_year (released year)
- rating (imdb rating)
- list_of_actors (list of actors)
- genre (genre)
- num_of_languages (num of languages)
- revenue (revenue)

They are important because they are attributes of a movie



* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
get_tuple


- What will the method do?
turn a Movie's attributes into a tuple with all its attributes as elements in the tuple


- Will it take any additional input? 
No. Just self


- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return a tuple. Nothing else is modified


- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
Because onece i have a list of movie tuples, I can insert them into the db table



ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
__str__


- What will the method do?
print the information of a Movie object


- Will it take any additional input? 
No. Just self.


- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
No. Just print out the movie's information. Nothing is modified.


- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
Because sometimes we want to see the information of a movie


[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?
- Movies
- Tweets
- Users



* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text ... 
(etc.)

Movies:
- imdb id (Primary key)
- title 
- director
- released year
- imdb rating
- list of actors
- genre
- num of language
- Revenue

Tweets:
- Tweet id (primary key)
- author id
- author screen name
- text
- created at
- The movie search this tweet came from
- num of favorites
- num of retweets

Users:
- User id (primary key)
- screen name
- description
- num of tweets
- location
- num of favorites
- num of retweets




* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")

1. To pick movies that have rating over 9.0
2. To pick tweets about movies that have a revenue higher than $50M (Tweets JOIN Movies)



* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 
1. zip
2. dictionary comprehension




* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
1. zip is for combining several list (attributes of a movie or a tweet) together and zip them into a tuple of attributes so that I can insert it into the table
2. dictionary comprehension is for getting the list of tweets to corresponding movie




* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
It will be a CSV file.

It will contain a movie table (regular info), a table with movies in the recent 5 years, a table of movies that have a revenue higher than $50 and a tweet about it with the highest the number of retweets
